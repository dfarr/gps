GPS File Parser

This is a GPS file parser I wrote in C for a second year computer science class. It works by reading in a .gps file and interacting with the file via comand line arguments. xgps.py Provides a graphical interface, however this requires specifing an SQL database, username and password as follows:

python xgps.py username password [hostname]
